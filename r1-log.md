# Log

### :calendar: R1D1
**Today's Progress:** I started my first @freeCodeCamp (Tribute Page) project.

**Thoughts:** I need to check CSS flexbox and grid.

### R1D2
**Today's Progress:** Working on @freeCodeCamp's Tribute Page.

I reviewed flexbox and grid CSS.


**Thoughts:** Summary and very nice content about flexbox and grid: 
- [Grid](http://grid.malven.co/)
- [flexbox](http://flexbox.malven.co/)

### :calendar: R1D3
**Today's Progress:** Studying a bit of css and JavaScript. (articles, youtube, book "Javascript - The Definitive Guide").

**Thoughts:** I'm having a bit of trouble with the photo gallery session on my Tribute Page. Reviewing and researching good CSS materials.

---

### :calendar: R1D4
**Today's Progress:** Studying a bit of css and JavaScript. (articles, youtube, book "The Definitive Guide Javascript").

**Thoughts:** Javascript - The Definitive Guide by David Flanagan is a excellent book.

**Resorces** Found 3 fun ways to learn more about CSS:

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)
- [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/)
- [CSS Dinner](http://flukeout.github.io/)

### :calendar: R1D5
**Today's Progress:** Studying CSS through the course of [Coding Artist](https://t.co/u9UAbEXmZR).

**Thoughts:** I started the course of [Coding Artist](https://t.co/u9UAbEXmZR). Relly good and recommended.

### :calendar: R1D6
**Today's Progress:** Progressing in CSS study through the @codingartist_io course.
I finished and submitted @freeCodeCamp's Tribute Page and Survey Form.
Developing a Learning Tracking on Github

**Thoughts:** The Survey Form project was a bit easier for me than the Tribute Page.
I had a little struggle to center the form on the page. And finally I remembered the "margin: self" ... it seems very simple and easy now.

The My Tribute Page photo gallery is working responsibly, but it still does not look as good as I wanted it to.

I have to review and learn a lot more about CSS.

### :calendar: R1D16
**Today's Progress:**  I have completed the FCC Technical Documentation page.

**thoughts** In this project I've struggled a little harder to pass the FCC test. It's because there was a typo in a href link in navbar and it took me a long time to find it. I broke my head, but after resolving it, it all seemed like a silly fail. I will add more content to this page in the future.

- JS Challenges on HackerRank #10daysofjavascript
- Today I worked on a very simple Web Project to train JS: A temperature converter. And as simple as it sounds, it did a bit of work. Mainly to understand how to handle the DOM. 
- I learned to store the value of an HTML input in a variable for use in JS.
- and I learned how to make the results appear simultaneously for the other two temperatures when I enter the temperature value to be converted (now it seems simple, but it took me a while to figure it out).

That way, whenever I have a free time, I will continue with these projects which are great and I will remain engaged in completing them.

- @freeCodeCamp: Object Oriented Programming (doing)
- Laboratoria: Project "Lyft Clone" (ok)

**Thoughts:** All of Laboratoria's projects seem impossible at first and far beyond my knowledge and capabilities. It's 50% of the time very difficult and it seems that really has no solution, so 20% of the time, thinking, "I do not know how, but I have to do it...", then 20% of the time: "I can do it!", Finally , 10% of the time: "I'm doing it, I'm really doing it!".

Day 100!
I am so happy to complete this challenge and for all the experiences, commitment and things I have learned through it.

Thanks all who have been with me and supported me! I hope to repeat it soon.

Learning never ends, and that's what's fun about it! 

...I'm still here breaking my head to manipulate the data in my project that has arrays with hundreds of objects, which in turn have several other arrays and objects and so on ...
