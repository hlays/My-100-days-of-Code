**Today's Progress:** I started my first @freeCodeCamp (Tribute Page) project.

### :calendar: R1D3
**Today's Progress:** Studying a bit of css and JavaScript. (articles, youtube, book "Javascript - The Definitive Guide").

### :calendar: R1D4
**Today's Progress:** Studying a bit of css and JavaScript. (articles, youtube, book "The Definitive Guide Javascript").

**Thoughts:** Javascript - The Definitive Guide by David Flanagan is a excellent book.

**Resorces** Found 3 fun ways to learn more about CSS:

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)
- [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/)
- [CSS Dinner](http://flukeout.github.io/)

**Today's Progress:** Studying CSS through the course of [Coding Artist](https://t.co/u9UAbEXmZR).

**Thoughts:** I started the course of [Coding Artist](https://t.co/u9UAbEXmZR). Relly good and recommended.

### :calendar: R1D6
**Today's Progress:** Progressing in CSS study through the @codingartist_io course.
I finished and submitted @freeCodeCamp's Tribute Page and Survey Form.
Developing a Learning Tracking on Github

**Thoughts:** The Survey Form project was a bit easier for me than the Tribute Page.
I had a little struggle to center the form on the page. And finally I remembered the "margin: self" ... it seems very simple and easy now.

The My Tribute Page photo gallery is working responsibly, but it still does not look as good as I wanted it to.

I have to review and learn a lot more about CSS.

### :calendar: R1D16
** Today's Progress: ** I have completed the FCC Technical Documentation page.

** Thoughts: ** In this project I've struggled a little harder to pass the FCC test. It's because there was a typo in a href link in navbar and it took me a long time to find it. I broke my head, but after resolving it, it all seemed like a silly fail. I will add more content to this page in the future.
